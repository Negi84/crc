            The severity of impacts from extreme and non-extreme weather and climate events is highly dependent on the degree of vulnerability and exposure to these events. Understanding the multifaceted nature of vulnerability and exposure is a prerequisite for determining how weather and climate events contribute to disaster occurrence and for designing and implementing effective adaptation and disaster risk management strategies. Vulnerability and exposure are dynamic, vary across temporal and spatial scales, and depend on economic, social, geographic, demographic, cultural, institutional, governance, and environmental factors. Individuals and communities are at risk and vulnerable to varying degrees based on factors such as wealth, education, race/ethnicity/religion, gender, age, class/caste, disability, and health status. Lack of resilience and the ability to anticipate, manage, and adapt to extremes and change are important causes of vulnerability. Vulnerability can mainly be broken down into two major categories, economic vulnerability, based on socioeconomic factors, and geographic vulnerability, which are not mutually exclusive.

                            <h4> IPCC</h4>
                            <p>The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) is the United Nations body for assessing the science related to climate change. The IPCC Sixth Assessment Report in 2022 stated that an important development in the IPCC assessments of vulnerability is that there is increasing recognition that the vulnerability of ecosystems and people to climate change varies widely between and within regions.   The UN Climate Council's report on the physical science of climate change, published on August 9, 2021, includes five possible scenarios for the future. The scenarios are the result of complex calculations that depend on how quickly people curb their greenhouse gas emissions. But the calculations are also intended to capture socioeconomic changes in areas such as population, urban density, education, land use, and wealth. For example, an increase in population is expected to lead to higher demand for fossil fuels and water and education can affect the rate of technological development. Each scenario is labelled to indicate both the level of emissions and the so-called Shared Socioeconomic Pathway (SSP) used in these calculations.</p>

                        <div>
                            <h4>Best Case Scenario</h4>
                            <p>The IPCC's most optimistic scenario describes a world in which global CO2 emissions are reduced to zero by 2050. This is the only scenario that achieves the Paris Agreement goal of holding global warming to about 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial temperatures. Societies shift to more sustainable practices, with a shift in focus from economic growth to overall well-being. Investment in education and health increases. Inequality decreases. Extreme weather events occur more frequently, but the world is spared the worst effects of climate change. Scenario 5 (the last) is a future to avoid at all costs. Current CO2 emissions levels roughly double by 2050. The global economy grows quickly, but this growth is fuelled by exploiting fossil fuels and energy-intensive lifestyles. By 2100, the average global temperature is a scorching 4.4 degree Celsius higher. The climate report can't predict which scenario is most likely as that depends on factors like government policy. But it does show how today's decisions will affect the future. In each scenario, warming will continue for at least a few decades. Sea levels will continue to rise for hundreds or thousands of years, and the Arctic will be virtually free of sea ice for at least one summer in the next 30 years. How quickly the seas rise and how dangerous the weather could become, however, depends on which path the world decides to take.</p>

                            <p>As an example of an overarching policy framework for climate action the Indian Government is implementing the National Action Plan on Climate Change (NAPCC), covering mitigation, adaptation and generation of strategic knowledge on climate change. It comprises of national missions in the specific areas of solar energy, enhanced energy efficiency, water, agriculture, the Himalayan eco-system, sustainable habitat, green India and strategic knowledge on climate change. Most of these missions are adaptation focussed. Further, 33 States/Union Territories have prepared State Action Plans on Climate Change (SAPCCs) consistent with the objectives of NAPCC. The Government is also implementing the National Adaptation Fund for Climate Change to support adaptation measures of States/UTs in areas that are particularly vulnerable to the adverse impacts of climate change.</p>

                            <h4>National Water Mission</h4>
                            <p>This mission aims to provide the best water resource management. This plan nationally promotes conservation of water and works on delivering equal water availability. The mission also aims to improve water resource efficiency by at least twenty per cent annually. It also focuses on conservation and improvement in the quality of groundwater.
                            It promotes ‘rainwater harvesting’ and encourages and acknowledges the efforts shown by individuals by awarding them, respectively. It also looks after the other issues like irrigation schemes, dam regulation and surface water management.

                        <div>
                            <h4>National Solar Mission</h4>
                            <p>This mission aims to maximize the use of solar energy for national power consumption purposes. As you all must know, solar energy is the largest available renewable and non-conventional source of energy.
                            Hence, if a developing country like India can discover and implement practical and feasible ways to use solar energy commercially, it will be extremely beneficial to both economic and environmental fronts of the country.
                            Currently, a lot of trials and researches are going on to explore the functioning of solar panels at local levels. The mission can take a longer time than the anticipated procedure as manufacturing these panels at a large scale is not very cost-effective.

                            <h4>National Mission on Sustainable Habitat</h4>
                            <p>This mission has been in the making for a long time. This mission is a joint promotion of sustainable development. These include proper waste management system, switching to renewable energy resources, separation of biodegradable and non-biodegradable components and take care of their disposition accordingly, etc. The mission also aims to bring in an eco-friendly transport system and promotes the adoption of the carpool transport system.</p>

                            <h4>National Mission for Enhanced Energy Efficiency</h4>
                            <p>India already has an act termed as “Energy Conservation Act” (enacted in 2001, I.e. way before the announcement of NAPCC) to prevent wastage of energy. This mission just acts on emphasizing these measures even more. Thus, both of these acts promote switching to the renewable and non-conventional sources of energy and prevent wastage of power and energy in any form. They also support cost-effective measures to increase energy efficiency.</p>

                        <div>
                            <h4>National Mission for Strategic Knowledge for Climate Change</h4>
                            <p>This mission has been wholly contributed to deal with the major issues revolving around the climate changes. Not only India, but many other nations in the world are also collectively participating in this research of the challenges that we hold.
                            The climate changes have affected both the humankind and nature to an extreme extent. Thus, this mission aims to gain full knowledge of the relevant situation and detailed survey reports of the constant changes going on, to be prepared beforehand to combat the case in the best ways possible.

Climate change is not just about rising temperatures, but about a variety of different changes in different regions that will intensify as warming continues. These include changes in wetness and drought, winds, snow and ice, coastal areas, and oceans</p>

                                    As climate change intensifies the hydrological cycle, many regions will experience more intense precipitation and associated floods, as well as more intense droughts. At high latitudes, precipitation is likely to increase, while it will decrease in many regions of the subtropics. Changes in monsoon precipitation are expected, however, they will vary by region. For example, climate change is expected to reduce freshwater availability in Central, South, East, and Southeast Asia, particularly in large river basins. Efforts by the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) to mitigate climate change are disproportionate to the threats facing the region. Given population growth and rising demand due to higher living standards, this decline could affect more than one billion people by 2050.

                                    Low-lying coastal areas are particularly at risk as sea levels continue to rise, leading to more frequent and severe coastal flooding and coastal erosion. Extreme sea level events, which previously occurred once every 100 years, could occur every year by the end of this century. Small islands, whether located in the tropics or at higher latitudes, are already subject to extreme weather events and sea level changes.   For historical reasons related to trade, many of the world's largest and most prosperous cities are located on the coast. In developing countries, the poorest often live in floodplains because it is the only available space or fertile agricultural land. These settlements often lack infrastructure such as levees and early warning systems. For example, India has more than 7,500 km of a varied coastline with different geology and geomorphology. In addition, India has a large population living in these low-lying, flood-prone, but economically important areas such as Mumbai, Chennai, and Kolkata. Major economic sectors, such as fishing, agriculture, tourism, energy, transportation, and communications, are all located in the coastal zone and are therefore affected by climate change.

                                    Further warming will increase thawing of permafrost, loss of seasonal snow cover, melting of glaciers and ice sheets, and loss of Arctic Sea ice in summer. These changes affect both ocean ecosystems and the people who rely on them, and they will continue for at least the rest of this century. For cities, some aspects of climate change may intensify, including heat (since urban areas tend to be warmer than their surrounding areas), flooding from heavy precipitation, and sea-level rise in coastal cities.

                        <p>People are experiencing climate change in diverse ways, especially people living in small island nations and other developing countries are more vulnerable to climate impacts than others. Developing countries are the most vulnerable to climate change impacts because they have fewer resources to adapt: socially, technologically and financially. Individual and social factors such as gender, age, education, ethnicity, geography and language lead to differential vulnerability and capacity to adapt to the impacts of climate change. A more vulnerable group is people living in poverty as they are disproportionally higher affected by the negative impacts of climate change. Poorer communities also tend to lack the insurance, savings, or access to credit needed to recover from disasters. A World Bank paper estimates that between 32 million and 132 million additional people will be pushed into extreme poverty by 2030 due to climate change. Moreover, women and children are extremely vulnerable as gender inequality increases and an overall negative impact on the social and political rights of women, especially in economies with an agricultural focus is triggered by climate change. Another vulnerable group are Indigenous communities, which tend to be geographically located in more vulnerable regions to climate change e.g., native rainforests, the Arctic, and coastal areas. Indigenous communities across the globe generally have economic disadvantages that are not as prevalent in non-indigenous communities due to the ongoing oppression they have experienced.</p>
