            Climate Change Vulnerability
            </h1>

            The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) is the United Nations body for assessing the science related to climate change. The IPCC Sixth Assessment Report in 2022 stated that an important development in the IPCC assessments of vulnerability is that there is increasing recognition that the vulnerability of ecosystems and people to climate change varies widely between and within regions.    The UN Climate Council's report on the physical science of climate change, published on August 9, 2021, includes five possible scenarios for the future. The scenarios are the result of complex calculations that depend on how quickly people curb their greenhouse gas emissions. But the calculations are also intended to capture socioeconomic changes in areas such as population, urban density, education, land use, and wealth. For example, an increase in population is expected to lead to higher demand for fossil fuels and water and education can affect the rate of technological development. Each scenario is labelled to indicate both the level of emissions and the so-called Shared Socioeconomic Pathway (SSP) used in these calculations.

            <div class="text-justify fs-18 pb-3 lh-1-8 card-text text-238095">
            The IPCC's most optimistic scenario describes a world in which global CO2 emissions are reduced to zero by 2050. This is the only scenario that achieves the Paris Agreement goal of holding global warming to about 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial temperatures. Societies shift to more sustainable practices, with a shift in focus from economic growth to overall well-being. Investment in education and health increases. Inequality decreases. Extreme weather events occur more frequently, but the world is spared the worst effects of climate change. Scenario 5 (the last) is a future to avoid at all costs. Current CO2 emissions levels roughly double by 2050. The global economy grows quickly, but this growth is fuelled by exploiting fossil fuels and energy-intensive lifestyles. By 2100, the average global temperature is a scorching 4.4 degree Celsius higher. The climate report can't predict which scenario is most likely as that depends on factors like government policy. But it does show how today's decisions will affect the future. In each scenario, warming will continue for at least a few decades. Sea levels will continue to rise for hundreds or thousands of years, and the Arctic will be virtually free of sea ice for at least one summer in the next 30 years. How quickly the seas rise and how dangerous the weather could become, however, depends on which path the world decides to take.

            As an example of an overarching policy framework for climate action the Indian Government is implementing the National Action Plan on Climate Change (NAPCC), covering mitigation, adaptation and generation of strategic knowledge on climate change. It comprises of national missions in the specific areas of solar energy, enhanced energy efficiency, water, agriculture, the Himalayan eco-system, sustainable habitat, green India and strategic knowledge on climate change. Most of these missions are adaptation focussed. Further, 33 States/Union Territories have prepared State Action Plans on Climate Change (SAPCCs) consistent with the objectives of NAPCC. The Government is also implementing the National Adaptation Fund for Climate Change to support adaptation measures of States/UTs in areas that are particularly vulnerable to the adverse impacts of climate change.

                                    The severity of impacts from extreme and non-extreme weather and climate events is highly dependent on the degree of vulnerability and exposure to these events. Understanding the multifaceted nature of vulnerability and exposure is a prerequisite for determining how weather and climate events contribute to disaster occurrence and for designing and implementing effective adaptation and disaster risk management strategies. Vulnerability and exposure are dynamic, vary across temporal and spatial scales, and depend on economic, social, geographic, demographic, cultural, institutional, governance, and environmental factors. Individuals and communities are at risk and vulnerable to varying degrees based on factors such as wealth, education, race/ethnicity/religion, gender, age, class/caste, disability, and health status. Lack of resilience and the ability to anticipate, manage, and adapt to extremes and change are important causes of vulnerability.  Vulnerability can mainly be broken down into two major categories, economic vulnerability, based on socioeconomic factors, and geographic vulnerability, which are not mutually exclusive.

                                    Regions that are likely to be particularly affected by climate change include the Arctic, Africa, small islands, and low-lying Asian coastal landscapes (megadeltas).    Most at risk of experiencing negative impacts of climate change are the less developed low-latitude regions.  Climate change is not just about rising temperatures, but about a variety of different changes in different regions that will intensify as warming continues. These include changes in wetness and drought, winds, snow and ice, coastal areas, and oceans.

                                    People are experiencing climate change in diverse ways, especially people living in small island nations and other developing countries are more vulnerable to climate impacts than others.  Developing countries are the most vulnerable to climate change impacts because they have fewer resources to adapt: socially, technologically and financially. Individual and social factors such as gender, age, education, ethnicity, geography and language lead to differential vulnerability and capacity to adapt to the impacts of climate change.  A more vulnerable group is people living in poverty as they are disproportionally higher affected by the negative impacts of climate change. Poorer communities also tend to lack the insurance, savings, or access to credit needed to recover from disasters. A World Bank paper estimates that between 32 million and 132 million additional people will be pushed into extreme poverty by 2030 due to climate change.  Moreover, women and children are extremely vulnerable as gender inequality increases and an overall negative impact on the social and political rights of women, especially in economies with an agricultural focus is triggered by climate change.  Another vulnerable group are Indigenous communities, which tend to be geographically located in more vulnerable regions to climate change e.g., native rainforests, the Arctic, and coastal areas. Indigenous communities across the globe generally have economic disadvantages that are not as prevalent in non-indigenous communities due to the ongoing oppression they have experienced.
